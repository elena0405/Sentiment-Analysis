# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentimental analysis of Decathlon reviews in 2 categories: polarity (positive or negative) and a range from 1 to 5 (1 = very negative, 5 = very positive). 
Both implementations used Flan-t5 and BERT language models and the results were compared using four confusion matrices and other performance metrics like F1 score, recall factor and precision factor.
